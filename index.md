## Welcome to Continuous Delivery Users

Continuous Delivery Users is a plain vanilla user group. It's an alliance for people within the software industry who are interested and engaged in the principles of Continuous Delivery and who wants to share their experiences, worries, challenges and successes and to learn from each other.

If you have got the DevOps at heart and are interesting in anything _continuous_ you've come to the right place.

### CoDe
We are using the abbreviation `CoDe` the refer to `Co`ntinuous `De`livery. We like it better than plain _CD_ simply because CD can mean a lot of things: _Corpse Diplomatique_, _Compact Disc_, _Cursor Down_, _Can't Deliver_, _Civil Disobedience_. CD is already exhausted. 

On the contrary CoDe has a lovely ambiguity build in; 'Are they talking about code - as in software code?' 'Yes, in a way we are!'

CoDe is exactly dealing with the quality of code.

A person who exercises CoDe is a _continuous deliverer_ or simply a CoDe:er.
