## Welcome to Continuous Delivery Users

This is the home of the professionally driven user group Continuous Delivery Users. It's an alliance for people within the software industry who are interested and engaged in the principles of Continuous Delivery and who wants to share their experiences, worries, challenges and successes and to learn from each other.

If you have got the DevOps at heart and are interesting in anything _continuous_ you've come to the right place.

### CoDe
We are using the abbreviation `CoDe` the refer to `Co`ntinuous `De`livery. We like it better than plain _CD_ simply because CD can mean a lot of things: _Corpse Diplomatique_, _Compact Disc_, _Cursor Down_, _Can't Deliver_, _Civil Disobedience_. CD is already exhausted. 

On the contrary CoDe has a lovely ambiguity build in; 'Are they talking about code - as in software code?' 'Yes, in a way we are!'

CoDe is exactly dealing with the quality of code.

### Share and meet

CoDe:U, the user group, is all about sharing experiences and meeting with peers. We have met in the user group in different _chapters_ and if you would like to help arrange a meeting in your area we would very much like that.

To keep yourself continuously updated, you can follow us on twitter [@contdeliu](http://twitter.com/contdeliu) or join the [CoDe:U group](http://www.linkedin.com/groups?home=&gid=4893734) on LinkedIn. we're already counting more than 200 members.
